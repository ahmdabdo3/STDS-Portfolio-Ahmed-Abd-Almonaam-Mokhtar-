## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using **Tableau** to monitor workforce metrics and employee trends. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool for HR managers to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rates, headcount, employee satisfaction, and demographic distributions.

The objective is to provide actionable insights into workforce dynamics, helping the organization improve retention strategies and optimize talent management.
