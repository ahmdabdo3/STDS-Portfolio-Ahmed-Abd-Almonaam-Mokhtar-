## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (Data Querying):** Used to perform complex queries, aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`), and grouping to extract KPIs and trends from the raw database.
* **Excel (Data Visualization):** Used to create Pivot Tables and Charts (Bar, Line, Pie) to visualize the SQL outputs.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled data types and formatted date/currency fields for accurate analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights & Trends

### 1. 📅 Daily & Monthly Trends
* **Busiest Days:** **Friday** and **Saturday** see the highest volume of orders, indicating a strong weekend demand.
* **Peak Months:** **July** and **May** recorded the highest order activity, while consumption dips slightly towards the end of the year.

### 2. 🥧 Sales by Category & Size

## 💻 SQL Methodology

The project utilized advanced SQL queries to derive insights. Below is a conceptual overview of the queries used:

```sql
-- Example: Calculating Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

-- Example: Daily Trend for Total Orders
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);

-- Example: % of Sales by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
(Note: Full SQL script is available in the repository file SQL + EXCEL.sql)

## 📉 Visualizations

The Excel dashboard serves as the central reporting tool, featuring:
* **KPI Cards:** Highlighting the main financial metrics at a glance.
* **Trend Charts:** Line charts visualizing daily and monthly order trends to identify peak times.
* **Distribution Charts:** Pie charts showing sales percentage breakdown by pizza category and size.
* **Ranking Charts:** Bar charts distinctively displaying the top 5 and bottom 5 selling pizzas.

## 🚀 Business Recommendations

Based on the data-driven insights, the following strategies are proposed:

1.  **Promotional Offers:** Launch targeted promotions for the **Brie Carre Pizza** to boost its sales, or consider removing it from the menu if low performance persists.
2.  **Inventory Management:** Optimize stock levels for **Classic** pizzas and **Large** size dough, ensuring sufficient supply specifically before **Fridays and Saturdays**.
3.  **Seasonal Marketing:** Maximize marketing spend during **July and May** to capitalize on historically peak demand periods.
