| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **💰 Total Revenue** | **$817,860** | The sum of the total price of all pizza orders. |
| **📦 Total Orders** | **21,350** | The total number of orders placed. |
| **🍕 Total Pizzas Sold** | **49,574** | The total quantity of pizzas sold. |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (Data Querying):** Used to perform complex queries, aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`), and grouping to extract KPIs and trends from the raw database.
* **Excel (Data Visualization):** Used to create Pivot Tables and Charts (Bar, Line, Pie) to visualize the SQL outputs.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled data types and formatted date/currency fields for accurate analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights & Trends

### 1. 📅 Daily & Monthly Trends
* **Busiest Days:** **Friday** and **Saturday** see the highest volume of orders, indicating a strong weekend demand.
* **Peak Months:** **July** and **May** recorded the highest order activity, while consumption dips slightly towards the end of the year.

### 2. 🥧 Sales by Category & Size
* **Top Category:** The **Classic** category contributes the most to both total orders and total revenue.
* **Preferred Size:** **Large (L)** pizzas are the most popular choice among customers, accounting for the highest percentage of sales, followed by Medium (M).

### 3. 🏆 Best & Worst Sellers
Analysis of top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas based on Revenue, Quantity, and Total Orders:

## 💻 SQL Methodology

The project utilized advanced SQL queries to derive insights. Below is a conceptual overview of the queries used:

```sql
-- Example: Calculating Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

-- Example: Daily Trend for Total Orders
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);

-- Example: % of Sales by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
(Note: Full SQL script is available in the repository file SQL + EXCEL.sql)
