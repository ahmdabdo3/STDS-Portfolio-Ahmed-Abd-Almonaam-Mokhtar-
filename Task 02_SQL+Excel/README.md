🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis – SQL & Excel Dashboard

This project presents an end-to-end sales analysis workflow, starting from SQL-based data analysis and ending with a fully interactive Excel dashboard to visualize key business insights from pizza sales data.

The goal is to demonstrate strong skills in data extraction, transformation, analysis using SQL, followed by data visualization and dashboarding in Excel.

🗄️ Data Preparation & SQL Analysis

Before building the Excel dashboard, the dataset was explored and analyzed using SQL to:

Clean and validate raw sales data

Aggregate key metrics such as:

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Total Pizzas Sold

Average Order Value (AOV)

Analyze sales performance by:

Date, day of week, and hour

Pizza category and size

Individual pizza items

Identify:

Peak ordering times

Best and worst selling pizzas

Category and size contribution to total sales

The SQL queries were used to create structured, analysis-ready datasets, which were then exported and connected to Excel for dashboard creation.

📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Revenue: $817,860

Average Order Value: $38.31

Total Pizzas Sold: 49,574

Total Orders: 21,350
