## 🗄️ Data Preparation & SQL Workflow

Before visualization, the data underwent a rigorous preparation phase using SQL:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Validated inconsistent values and handled nulls.
2.  **Aggregation:** calculated core business metrics at the transaction level.
3.  **View Creation:** Developed SQL views for:
    * Yearly/Quarterly/Monthly trends.
    * Product Category & Subcategory performance.
    * Customer-level segmentation.
